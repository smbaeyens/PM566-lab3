\#Reading in Data

``` r
#download file ONLY IF it has not been downloaded previously
if (!file.exists("met_all.gz")) {
  download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz", "met_all.gz", method="libcurl", timeout = 60)}
met <- data.table::fread("met_all.gz")
```

\#Checking dimensions

``` r
x= dim(met)
head(met)
```

Temperature fluctuates throughout each day, with the maximum (btwn 10 &
15C) and minimum (btwn 2 & 6C) temperatures per day remaining relatively
constant between days. It is likely that the max temp each day is around
noon and the minimum at midnight, but would need clearer time stamps
(including hours) to verify.

Wind changes much more randomly during and between days. It was very
windy between August 12th and August 18th and between the 24th and 27th.
